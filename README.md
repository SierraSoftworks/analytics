**Lightweight, privacy preserving, analytics for your website(s).**

This project provides a simple, lightweight, and privacy preserving analytics solution for your website(s).
It is written in Rust, designed to be self-hosted at extremely low cost, provides a simple tracking API for
view counts, and ensures that your users' privacy is respected by keeping the data collected as simple as
possible (just the number of times the page is viewed and/or liked).
